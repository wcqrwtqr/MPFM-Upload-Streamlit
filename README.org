#+TITL: MPFM-Upload-Streamlit

* Streamlit data visualizer

This site handles the data used for the operation in OILSERV with several type of equipment such as MPFM from ROXAR, metrolog and spartek down hole gauges as well was a page for simulating the number of trucks to load oil from well site based on the time of loading.

+The data can be uploaded to the website of Heruko and it will perform a number of tasks such as:+

The data can be uploaded to the website of either on streamlit page or run it locally on your machine and it will perform a number of tasks such as:

1. Data visualization
2. Data averaging and download to csv files
3. Create a correlation plot (for MPFM only)
4. Graph any axis from the data interactively
5. Make PVT data generation for oil and gas
6. Compute the air compressor size capacity needed for operation
7. Sizing for pressure separator
8. Simulate the number of expected trucks while loading operation of oil into trucks


This project uses the following libraries:

 1. Streamlit
 2. Pandas
 3. Numpy
 4. Plotly
 5. Seaboarn

* Running the app in your local machine using docker or docker-compose

To use docker you can to be able to run the application locally from a container start by cloning the repository then run the below lines in the terminal

#+begin_src bash
# clone the repo to your pc
git clone <github repo url>
# cd into the folder
cd /MPFM-Upload-Streamlit
# build docker image using the command below
docker build -t mpfm:latest . -f Dockerfile
# run the docker container
docker run -p 8501:8501 mpfm:latest
#+end_src

Or better to use the blow one command only (Recommended)

#+begin_src bash
docker-compose up --buil
#+end_src

After the docker builds the image it will run the docker container and now you can access the web page using the below url

http://localhost:8501

* Next actions
** TODO Update the version of the dependencies
** TODO Update the UI with new elemens ts of the streamlit library
** TODO Add other tabs for conversion rates and other
