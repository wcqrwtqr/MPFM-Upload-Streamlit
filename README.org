#+TITL: MPFM-Upload-Streamlit

* Streamlit data visualizer

This site handles the data used for the operaiton in OILSERV with several type of equipment such as MPFM from ROXAR, metrolog and spartek down hole gauges as well was a page for simulating the number of trucks to load oil from well site based on the time of loading.

The data can be uploaded to the website of Heruko and it will perform a number of tasks such as:

1. Data visualization
2. Data averaging and download to csv files
3. create a correlation plot (for MPFM only)
4. Graph any axis from the data interactively

Another added feature is to simulate the number of trucks needed to load oil from a well site or a loading station based on the time needed to fill a tanker vs the number of loading stations available.

This project uses the following libraries:

 1. Streamlit
 2. Pandas
 3. Numpy
 4. Plotly
 5. seaboarn
